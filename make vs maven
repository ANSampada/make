🔧 1. make

What it is:
	A build automation tool (GNU make) that reads a file called a Makefile.

What it does:
	Defines rules: “to build target X, compile sources A + B.”
	Runs commands automatically if sources are newer than outputs.
	Supports parallelism via -jN (e.g., -j16).

In MAINLINE job:
	It drives the build process for both Legacy and VM builds (make O=legacy, make O=vm).
	It is the top-level orchestrator in Buildroot and Cisco scripts.

🔧 2. jam
What it is:
	A build tool similar to make, but lighter and sometimes faster.
	Originally from Perforce, used in embedded/firmware projects.

What it does:
	Reads Jamfiles instead of Makefiles.
	Known for handling large dependency graphs quickly.

In MAINLINE job:
	Cisco’s build system still uses jam in certain modules (especially legacy ones).
	That’s why we see a tuning variable:
	FORCE_JAMFLAGS_JLEVEL=8
	→ it controls how many parallel jobs jam is allowed to run.

🔧 3. Buildroot
What it is:
	An open-source tool used to generate embedded Linux systems.

What it does:
	Builds a complete Linux system (kernel, bootloader, rootfs, toolchains).
	Automates fetching sources, applying patches, and compiling everything.

In MAINLINE job:
	The heart of the VM/Legacy builds.
	Pulls sources defined in its manifests (manifest.txt).
	Builds toolchains, libraries, applications, and outputs disk images.

Parallelism is tuned with:
	FORCE_BR2_JLEVEL=8

(which maps to Buildroot’s BR2_JLEVEL variable).
⚙️ How they fit together in MAINLINE
	make (top-level driver)
	Calls into Buildroot and jam.
	jam (legacy sub-builds)
	Compiles specific components (older parts of the codebase).
	Buildroot (system builder)
		Builds the Linux system, rootfs, kernel, and packages.

✅ Analogy:
make = the general contractor on a construction site.
jam = a subcontractor specializing in older systems.
Buildroot = a factory that builds an entire pre-fab house (a Linux system image).

Is a make is build tool?
Yes 👍 — GNU make is one of the most classic build tools.

🔧 What does “build tool” mean?
	A build tool is software that:
	Reads a set of rules (like Makefiles).
	Figures out what needs to be compiled or generated.
	Runs the necessary commands (e.g., gcc -c file.c) in the right order.
	Avoids unnecessary work (only rebuilds what changed).

🔨 What make does
	Input = Makefile (rules written by developers).
	Process = checks timestamps of files and dependencies.
	Output = runs compiler/linker commands to produce binaries, libraries, or images.
	Example:
		hello: hello.c
		    gcc -o hello hello.c

If you run:
make
It compiles hello.c into the binary hello.
With -j16, it can compile many files in parallel.

✅ So to answer simply:

👉 Yes, make is a build tool — one of the most widely used in Unix/Linux systems.
It’s the top-level tool in your MAINLINE job that orchestrates jam and Buildroot underneath.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even maven is also build tool right then what is the difference between make and maven?

🔧 make
Origin: Unix world (1970s, GNU make is the most common).
Primary use: Compiling C, C++ and other native code.
Input: A Makefile written by developers.
Build model:
Rule-based: “to build X, you need Y → run this command.”

Example:
hello: hello.c
    gcc -o hello hello.c

Dependency management:
Very basic → based on file timestamps.
Doesn’t know about external libraries (you must fetch/install them manually).
Scope: OS-level / system software / embedded (like your MAINLINE job).

🔧 Maven
Origin: Java ecosystem (early 2000s, Apache).
Primary use: Building Java projects (JARs, WARs, EARs).
Input: pom.xml (Project Object Model).
Build model:
Lifecycle phases (compile → test → package → install → deploy).
Convention-over-configuration (less custom scripting).
Dependency management:
Built-in! Maven automatically downloads libraries (from Maven Central or internal repos like engci-maven-master.cisco.com).
Handles versioning, transitive dependencies, etc.
Scope: Application-level builds (enterprise apps, microservices).

⚖️ Key Differences
Feature	make 🛠️  |(C/Unix)	                            |maven ☕ (Java)
Ecosystem	       |C, C++, embedded, system software	    |Java, JVM languages (Scala, Kotlin, etc.)
Build definition |Makefile (rules & shell commands)	    |pom.xml (XML config)
Dependency       |mgmt	Manual (install libs yourself)	|Automatic (fetch from Maven repos)
Build style	     |Rule-based (low-level control)	      |Lifecycle phases (high-level workflow)
Typical artifacts|Binaries, libraries, OS images      	|JARs, WARs, EARs
Parallelism	     |make -jN (manual control)	Limited     |parallelization (plugins, newer builds)
Strengths	       |Speed, flexibility, close to OS     	|Dependency management, ecosystem tooling

✅ In short:
make = low-level, flexible system/embedded build tool. You tell it exactly how to build things.
Maven = high-level Java build & dependency management tool. You describe what you want, Maven handles the rest.

🔨 make in MAINLINE

Where used:
Core of the Legacy and VM builds.
Triggered by commands like:
make O=legacy ...
make O=vm ...

MAINLINE
What it does:
Drives the Buildroot system (compiling toolchains, rootfs, kernel, binaries).
Runs with -j16 parallelism (plus FORCE_JAMFLAGS_JLEVEL and FORCE_BR2_JLEVEL).

Output:
Raw binaries, rootfs, disk images → which later get packaged into the OVA.
👉 So: make = the engine of the native build.

☕ maven in MAINLINE
Where used:
Not in the core build stage.
It comes in when the job interacts with Cisco’s internal Maven repo (https://engci-maven-master.cisco.com).
That repo is referenced for Java dependencies and artifacts — for example, build-support or notification components (like cms-build-notify-2024).

What it does:
Handles downloading/publishing Java-based tools the pipeline needs.
Example: notification modules, packaging helpers, or supporting libraries.

Output:
JARs/WARs used by the build scripts (not the OVA directly).
👉 So: maven = used indirectly, for Java components & dependency fetching.

✅ Combined picture for MAINLINE
make → runs inside the build containers, compiles everything, produces Linux images and VM outputs.
maven → supports the job by fetching/using Java tools and dependencies (from Cisco’s internal Maven repo).

📌 Important: In the log you provided, I saw heavy make usage.
Direct Maven commands (mvn compile, mvn deploy, etc.) were not in this MAINLINE log, but references to Maven artifacts (engci-maven-master.cisco.com) indicate Maven is used for dependencies, just not front-and-center in this job.
