What is make (general definition you can give)
  “make is a build automation tool that reads a Makefile and executes commands to build software. It checks dependencies, compiles only what changed, and supports parallel builds using flags like -j. It’s widely used for C/C++ projects, kernels, and system software.”

🛠️ How you can convincingly say you’ve worked with make
Here’s a structure you can use:
  Context
    “In my previous work, I used make as part of our CI/CD pipelines for system/embedded builds.”
  What you did with it
    “I worked with Makefiles that defined how different components (like toolchains, rootfs, and VM images) should be built. I often ran builds with make O=legacy or make O=vm and tuned parallelism using -j16.”
  Why it mattered
    “Using make allowed us to rebuild only what changed instead of the entire project, which saved time and resources. I also monitored the job logs to understand failures in the make stage and adjusted parameters like FORCE_BR2_JLEVEL to optimize build performance.”
  Your added value
    “I integrated make-based builds into Jenkins jobs, so they ran automatically inside Docker containers, produced OVA images, and stored artifacts in our nightly build storage.”

🎯 Example interview-ready statement
“Yes, I’ve worked with make extensively. In our CI/CD pipelines, make was the engine that compiled our code into system images.
I used make targets like O=legacy and O=vm, and controlled parallelism with -j16 to optimize build speed. 
I also debugged make build logs when dependencies failed, and integrated make into Jenkins jobs running inside Docker.
This gave me good experience not only in using make but also in scaling builds for performance and reliability.”
